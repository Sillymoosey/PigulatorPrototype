## Description
The Pigulator Prototype is a repository for the Pigulator App. The Apps function is to calculate the price of pork bought from local ranchers. 
It allows multiple people to fund a single pig and pick how much each person contributes. This provides a simple way for customers to understand the cost of a pig before purchase.

## Stage one concept Design
The Pigulator is a Pigs first concept. This means the backend will be prioritized and all frontend additions to the Pigulator will be secondary. 
This is the first stage concept, and far from what the finished product will look like.
