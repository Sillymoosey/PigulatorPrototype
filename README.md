# PigulatorPrototype

## Description
The Pigulator Prototype is a repository for the Pigulator App. The Apps function is to calculate the price of pork bought from local ranchers. 
It allows multiple people to fund a single pig and pick how much each person contributes. This provides a simple way for customers to understand the cost of a pig before purchase.
